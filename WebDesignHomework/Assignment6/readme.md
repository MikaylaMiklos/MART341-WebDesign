#### Reasoning

I've chosen to go with my personal style blog idea. I went with this idea because I think Its the one idea that I wont get tired of. I want the site to have a cozy feel and the style will be based on my own tastes and interests. 

#### Balance 

Adjusting the color and width of the elements made text and lists more legible. I had a bit of difficulty making the photos balanced, but by playing with the width I could make it work.

#### Float and Margin experience

For my left and right images using float was super easy, and I had no problems. However the photo in the middle gave me problems since it kept on aligning to the right, I couldn't figure out a way to center align it unfortunately even with the margins. I tried other Style ways in attempt to center it, but none worked. In the end I just Adjusted the width to make it look center. This was my only problem, I was using w3schools throughout making my website which helped streamline the process.
