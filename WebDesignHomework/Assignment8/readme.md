### work through the assignment, track how and why you used each technique on your new page.

**Div (at least 2)**
 - replaced font throughout the old and new html pages by using divs and referencing style.
 - I used divs to keep my blocks seperated so that the code is easy to navigate for me.

**Span (at least 2)**
- used span to highlight important text
- Used span to color my links so they dont overwhelm the sight with the blue color they originally have.

**Audio (at least 1)**
 - I found an audio from freesound and used it in my Index page, I would've put my favorite song but I'm pretty sure I'm not allowed to due to copyright.

**Video (at least 1)**
 - I implemented a video using an Iframe on my Fashion page.

**Iframe (at least 1)**
 - Included an Iframe in my fashion page. Originally I was going to put a website but firefox won't allow me display it due to security risks.

**Class (at least 2)**
 - I've been using class to define the font for my text so far.
 - I've also used class to higlight details about me and links.

**Escape character (at least 1)**
 - I used escape characters to create an emoticon in my Index because I didn't know what else to use them for, I'd argue it goes along with the blog theme because kaomojis are often seen and used in blogs.
