### Page I'm Working On

I am just working on my **Blog page** from assignment 8, because I wanted to focus on how to organize divs.

### Required Techniques

**external CSS** linked to in index.html 

**class selector** Used for organizing and styling text

**Use at least 1 ID selector** used to style blurb paragraph. Attempted to style the interests block so they're inline but didn't end up working.

### Three Additional Techniques

**Different background colors:** I used a different background to make my text visible/legible.

**Different font colors:** different font colors for heirarchy.

**Positioning:** added margins, width, and height to position stuff nicely and in a blocked out manner.

**Text Alignment** used to style and add heirachy to the site.

**Borders** used for organizing text into blocks
