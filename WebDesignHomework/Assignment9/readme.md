## How to make Deviled Eggs
### History:

Deviled Eggs sometimes reffered as stuffed or curried eggs, they can be traced back to ancient Rome. The eggs are adorned with filing and seasoning or spices. In Ancient Rome they were often served during gatherings and feasts, as they are now. Later they were popularized in Andalusia, Spain, and Europe. Eventually in Britain they were dubbed "deviled" which was a term to describe spicy food at the time. Deviled Eggs have been made by halving a hard boiled egg. Then scooping the yolk out and mixing it with other ingredients and piping back into the egg. Often you will garnish it with paprika or other garnishes.

### Ingredients:

 - 12 eggs
 - 1/3 cup of mayonaise
 - 1 1/2 tsp of mustard
 - salt and pepper it to your liking
 - garnish with paprika (or preffered garnish)

### Recipe:
#### 1.&#41; Hard boil eggs:
using your preffered method hard boil 12 eggs. Normally because I'm lazy I go to the store and buy eggs that have already been hard boiled for me.
#### 2.&#41; Peel and Cut the Eggs:
once you've boiled the eggs peel the shells and cut the eggs in half
#### 3.&#41; Filling:
 Remove the yolks from the halves and place them in a bowl. Mash them up then add the mayo, mustard, salt, and pepper. Then mix it all together.
#### 4.&#41; Assemble:
 Use a tool of your choice, like a spoon or piping bag. Put the filling back into the egg white. Then garnish with paprika.
#### 5.&#41; Enjoy!
