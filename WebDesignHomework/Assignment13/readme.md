### Required Techniques:

**At Least 4 Pages** – I am using my blog page that I've been working on, but cut down some of the content to make it easier to work with.

**Responsive Design** – Design adjusts somewhat smoothly across desktop and mobile screen sizes. I tested it and the images are the only thing I'm having trouble sizing appropriately, so i used a media query to get rid of them on mobile. (I don't have a tablet to test on)


**Media Queries** – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.

I didnt really have a major use for them in this project, but I used one to change te paragraph to a darker color on small screens.


**Navigation Menu** – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.

Navigation menu is at the top of the page and this heirarchy helps get user interest to take interest in it. 

**Dropdown Menu** – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.
