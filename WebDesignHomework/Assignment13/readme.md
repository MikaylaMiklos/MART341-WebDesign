### Required Techniques:

**At Least 4 Pages** – I am using my blog page that I've been working on, but cut down some of the content to make it easier to work with.

**Responsive Design** – Design adjusts somewhat smoothly across desktop and mobile screen sizes. I tested it on my phone and the major problems are alignment and the navigation. Otherwise it is optimized on mobile. It may be a problem that I've only been able to test on my phone, I don't have a tablet to test on unfortunately.

**Media Queries** – I didnt really have a major use for them in this project, but I used one to change the paragraph to a darker color on small screens. I also used a query to remove images on mobile to make the content look better aligned.

**Navigation Menu** – Navigation menu is at the top of the page and this heirarchy helps get user interest to take interest in it. 

**Dropdown Menu** – I have a dropdown menu on both desktop and mobile. On mobile it was giving me problems, It's major issue was that when I clicked on my header it wouldn't open the dropdown menu. So as a temporary fix I made the nav links visbile, when clicked on they open up the dropdown menu for some reason. It's still functional, but thats the major issue.
