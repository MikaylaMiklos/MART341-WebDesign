## Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?

Website are structured and function by using a user interface, rendering engine, browser engine, the network, javascript, and data storage (cookies and local storage). The user interface is everything the user can interact with, while the rendering engine displays the visuals of the web page by taking in the .html and .css documents. The user engine directs actions between the user interface, rendering engine, and servers. The network communicates with the browser to recieve its content. Javascript helps with translating programming languages to different browsers. Cookies and local storage help with retaining the state of the page even if its been refreshed, such as your last high score in a game.

## What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? 

I found the concept of the DOM to be a bit confusing, but I understand it to be a interface that dictates how a document is executed in rendering a page. It does this by defining the documents structure logically so that other programming languages can modify the content.

## HTML, XML, XHTML—what sets them apart?

HTML - html is used to render page content and structure.

XML - xml is used to describe document nodes, it does not do anything beyond sharing information.

XHTML - xhtml is basically the same as html, the difference between them is that xhtml is that it has stricter code requirements. This means it takes longer and requires more precision to write, but it is easier to maintain.

## What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?

Every Html page needs a !DOCTYPE html, root, head, and body. All of which are enclosed in '<>' and '</>'.


## What’s the purpose of the index.html page, and where should it be placed?

The index.html page serves as the master HTML file, and it should be placed in the root folder.

## Review: What are the top naming practices for clean and organized code?

Best practice for naming web files and having organized code are:
   - no spaces
   - no odd characters
   - using capitals is discouraged, generally should use all lowercase lettering
   - if you want to add "spaces" you can use dashes or underscores.
   - don't start your file with a numeric character
