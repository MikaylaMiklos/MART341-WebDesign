<h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Personal journal</h3>

<p>This idea is nice because it'll allow me to think about coding in a more advanced way. For example, coding a function into the website that allows you to add a task onto the planner. Plus if it works out, I can actually use the website to plan my week. </p>

<h3>Style Blog</h3>

<p>This idea would be fun to do as it allows me to think about aesthetic choices. I like this idea the most because I think it allows me artistic freedom. Perhaps I can combine this idea with the personal journal. </p>

<h3>Womens travel</h3> 

<p>I like this idea, but out of the three it's my least favorite. I think it allows me freedom for creative choices and create a proffesional looking website. It could also be a good way to learn about some places to travel to. </p>
