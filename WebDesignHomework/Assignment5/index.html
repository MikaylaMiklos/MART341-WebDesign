    <h3>Website Idea 1 | Personal journal</h3>

    <p>
        My first idea for a website is a personal journal logging the work I get done throughout the week.<br> 
        This could include photos of my work done that week or 
        a checklist of things I need to do. Basically<br>
         it'd be a blog that details my schoolwork in an cute but concise manor.

    <h3>Website Idea 2 | Style Blog</h3>

    <p>
        My second idea and the one that appeals to me the most, is creating a website/blog that documents my personal style. <br>
        This could range from my favorite fashion, music, or photos that appeal to me at the moment. I want this site to <br>
        have a more personal feel and be something fun to mess around with, sort of like a Tumblr blog.

    <h3>Website Idea 3 | Womens travel</h2></h3>

    <p>
        Lastly I think a travel website aimed towards women could be cool. It would have information on safety and tips <br>
        for women who want to solo travel. For example I could have an interactive map with the least and most friendly countries <br>
        for women to travel to. It would have an informational tone and be fairly professional.
