**3+ Pages** – Re-used deviled egg instructable, contains multiple pages with a cohesive theme.

**Framework Integration** – Incorporated Bootstrap to enhance design and layout.

**Framework Styling Elements** – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal: used text align center and table styling, I found that since the page was already styled there was little left to do. The text align was super beneficial because it was already there for me to use, and the ingredients and recipe pages were left unstyled from a previous project.

**HTML5 Canvas** – Include an HTML5 canvas element: Created a deviled egg drawing to appear at the bottom of all the pages.

**JavaScript Functionality** – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site: initially I was going to animate the egg on the index.html to bob up and down, but I spent a little over an hour trying to figure it out on my own and with tutorials. It ended up not working in the end. So I refined my goal to be something more simpler and do-able, I changed the "deviled eggs" header to change color when hovered over.
