                Deviled Eggs sometimes reffered as stuffed or curried eggs, they can be traced back to ancient Rome. The eggs are adorned with filing  and seasoning or spices. In Ancient Rome they were often served during gatherings and feasts, as they are now. Later they were popularized in Andalusia, Spain, and Europe. Eventually in Britain they were dubbed "deviled" which was a term to describe spicy food at the time.

                Deviled Eggs have been made by halving a <br> hard boiled egg. Then scooping the yolk out and mixing it with other ingredients and piping back into the egg. Often you will garnish it with paprika or other garnishes. Click ingredients down below to learn more about making Deviled Eggs.
