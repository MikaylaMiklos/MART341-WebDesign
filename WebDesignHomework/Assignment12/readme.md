#### I am working on the instructable index.html (or 'history') page.

#### Select at least 6 of the following techniques to implement:

**Dropdown** – Created a dropdown menu for the navigation.

**Sizing** – Controled the size of the links menu in the dropdown.

**Position** – Used fixed position on navigation to stop it from pushing the other elements downwards.

**Border** – border around image and header to emphasize and seperate it.

**Padding** – Set the space inside the containers and text.

**Margin** – Adjusted the space outside the paragraph containers, creating separation from each other and the heading.

**Display** - Li are displayed inline.
