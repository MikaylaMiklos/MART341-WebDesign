### Required Techniques:

focused on just on the index.html this week again. I did change the other pages to reference the stylesheet though, I will fix the obvious problems with them later!

**external CSS style sheet**

**Add hover effects to enhance interactivity:** Added hover to change color and font of the links.

**Use an external font that is self-hosted:** Tried to, For some reason it did not work. I tried troubleshooting and it still didn't display the fonts I chose. So I gave up because it stressed me out too much and was wasting my time.

**Use an external font from a font library:** Used import embedding. Font doesn't appear exactly like the one I chose, but it did change the font.

### At Least Three Additional Techniques:

**Experiment with different font styles** I experimented with different font styles. When I was trying to get the self-hosted fonts to work I downloaded about 5 or 6 fonts trying to get each to work. I also used the embedded font and monospace.

**Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.** removed underlines on links in the navigation. 

**Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability** used leading/line-height on the paragraph to fill the container its in.
